# CS 288 Intensive Programming in Linux

The course deals with Bash, Python, and C programming along with learning various parts of the Linux operating system. One of the main goals of the course is to finish with the ability to program custom parts of a Linux os. This repository will store my personal implementations of all programming assignments.
